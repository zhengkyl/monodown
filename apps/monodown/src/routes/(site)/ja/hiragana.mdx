# Hiragana

Hiragana is the foundation for reading and writing Japanese. You'll gain a solid grasp of these within a few days, and you'll continue improving as you read more Japanese.

Each character represents a mora (roughly equivalent to syllable), and almost all of them consist of a consonant followed by a vowel.

That's why mastering the vowels is step one.
