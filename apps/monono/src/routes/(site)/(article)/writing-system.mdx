# Writing System


### Romanization

In these articles, Japanese will be written using Hepburn romanization whenever needed. The Hepburn system is the main way of writing Japanese using the Latin alphabet and it also happens to be more intuitive for English speakers.

There are variations and other romanization systems used in different contexts. For instance, some kana can be written in a more consistent way (eg. つ as tu, ぢ as di). Knowing these variations exist can be helpful in niche circumstances or when typing Japanese.

When learning Japanese words, its best to learn hiragana first instead of relying too much on romanization. This will help you practice reading and remembering pronunciation using the Japanese writing system.
