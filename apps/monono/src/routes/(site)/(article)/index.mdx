# What is Monono?

This is an attempt at filling gaps in the resources I found while learning Japanese. Since I have only been learning for <TimeElapsed/>, I intend for this to be a long term work-in-progress.

The name "monono" comes from "mono(lingual)" + "no" and it's intentionally compatible with Japanese phonology. In fact,「ものの」happens to be a conjunction.
